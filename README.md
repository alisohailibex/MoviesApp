### 1. Notes

1: This BaseUrl was updated in their documentation and adjusted accordingly "https://freetestapi.com/apis/movies" 
   but the issue is the Movie Posters are not valid urls instead I am only getting dimension dummy poster so the movies posters are not visibile

2: "https://mockx.net/docs/movie-api": This baseurl is not working at all so didnot use this one.
